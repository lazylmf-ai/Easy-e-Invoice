üéØ MALAYSIAN E-INVOICE TIP #1: Master Your TIN Numbers

Getting TIN validation wrong is the #1 reason for e-Invoice compliance failures. Here's your complete guide:

üè¢ COMPANY TINs (Sdn Bhd, Bhd, etc.)
‚úÖ Format: C + exactly 10 digits
‚úÖ Example: C1234567890  
‚ùå Wrong: 1234567890 (missing C)
‚ùå Wrong: C12345678901 (too many digits)

üë§ INDIVIDUAL TINs
‚úÖ Format: 12 digits (IC number)
‚úÖ Example: 123456789012
‚ùå Wrong: 123456-78-9012 (remove dashes)

üèõÔ∏è GOVERNMENT TINs  
‚úÖ Format: G + exactly 10 digits
‚úÖ Example: G1234567890

ü§ù NON-PROFIT TINs
‚úÖ Format: N + exactly 10 digits  
‚úÖ Example: N1234567890

üí° PRO TIPS:
‚Ä¢ Always verify TINs with SSM database
‚Ä¢ For B2B invoices, TIN is mandatory
‚Ä¢ For B2C invoices, TIN is optional
‚Ä¢ Easy e-Invoice validates TINs automatically in real-time

Getting 95% of TIN formats wrong costs Malaysian businesses thousands in penalties each year. Don't be part of that statistic!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Easy e-Invoice Launches Malaysia's First SME-Focused E-Invoice Compliance Platform

Purpose-built solution helps micro-SMEs achieve 90%+ LHDN compliance scores in minutes, not hours

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia ‚Äì [DATE] ‚Äì Easy e-Invoice today announced the launch of Malaysia's first e-Invoice compliance platform designed specifically for micro-SMEs. The platform addresses the critical challenge facing thousands of Malaysian small businesses as they prepare for LHDN's e-Invoice mandate, which becomes mandatory for companies with over RM 25 million in revenue starting January 2025.

"Malaysian SMEs are facing unprecedented compliance complexity with the e-Invoice mandate," said [CEO NAME], CEO and co-founder of Easy e-Invoice. "Existing solutions are designed for large enterprises and are too complex and expensive for small businesses. We built Easy e-Invoice from the ground up to make Malaysian e-Invoice compliance simple, affordable, and accessible to every SME."

The platform's key differentiators include:

‚Ä¢ **Malaysian-First Design**: Built-in TIN validation, MSIC 2008 industry codes, and automatic SST calculations specifically for Malaysian businesses
‚Ä¢ **Rapid Implementation**: Complete setup and first compliant invoice in under 10 minutes
‚Ä¢ **Affordability**: Starting at RM 0/month for up to 10 invoices, with unlimited invoices at RM 29/month
‚Ä¢ **Local Expertise**: Malaysian compliance experts providing support in English and Bahasa Malaysia
‚Ä¢ **Proven Results**: Early customers achieving 90%+ compliance scores consistently

**Addressing a Critical Market Need**

A recent survey by the Malaysian SME Association found that 73% of SMEs are concerned about e-Invoice compliance costs and complexity. Traditional enterprise solutions require months of implementation and cost thousands of ringgit monthly, making them unsuitable for businesses with limited resources.

"We surveyed over 500 Malaysian SMEs and found that the average business owner was spending 20+ minutes creating each invoice manually, with frequent compliance errors," said [CTO NAME], CTO and co-founder. "Our platform reduces this to 2-3 minutes with automatic validation, saving businesses hours every week while eliminating compliance risks."

**Early Customer Success**

Ace Digital Solutions Sdn Bhd, one of Easy e-Invoice's early customers, reduced their invoice processing time by 85% while achieving a 98% compliance score.

"Easy e-Invoice didn't just solve our compliance problem ‚Äì it gave me my life back," said Ahmad Rahman, CEO of Ace Digital Solutions. "I now spend time growing my business instead of drowning in paperwork. The Malaysian-specific features are incredible ‚Äì it knows our regulations better than most accountants."

**Market Opportunity**

Malaysia has over 900,000 registered SMEs, with the majority falling under the upcoming e-Invoice mandate. The market for SME-focused compliance solutions is estimated at over RM 100 million annually.

"This is a massive market opportunity to serve an underserved segment," said [INVESTOR NAME] from [VC FIRM], an early investor in Easy e-Invoice. "The team's deep understanding of Malaysian compliance requirements and SME needs positions them perfectly to capture significant market share."

**Platform Availability**

Easy e-Invoice is immediately available at [WEBSITE] with a free tier for up to 10 invoices monthly and paid plans starting at RM 29/month. The platform includes:

‚Ä¢ Real-time LHDN compliance validation

   "Have you started preparing for compliance?"
   [Listen for: Knowledge level, preparation status, concerns]

4. **Pain Points:**

   [Listen for: Specific problems, time consumption, error rates]

### Objection Handling Guide

#### Common Objections & Responses

**Objection 1: "We're not ready to think about e-Invoice yet"**

**Response:**
"I completely understand that feeling - many business owners feel the same way. Can I share what we're seeing with other Malaysian SMEs?

The businesses that start preparing now have a huge advantage:
‚Ä¢ They avoid the last-minute rush when everyone's scrambling
‚Ä¢ They perfect their processes before they become mandatory
‚Ä¢ They actually save time and money starting today

Plus, with our free tier, you can start exploring with zero risk. Would it be worth 10 minutes to see if this could actually help your business now, not just for compliance later?"

**Objection 2: "We already have accounting software"**

**Response:**
"That's great - having good accounting software is important. Most of our customers actually keep using their existing accounting software alongside Easy e-Invoice.

The challenge is that general accounting software wasn't built for Malaysian e-Invoice compliance specifically. They might handle basic invoicing, but do they:
‚Ä¢ Validate TIN numbers in real-time against Malaysian formats?
‚Ä¢ Include the complete MSIC 2008 industry code database?
‚Ä¢ Calculate SST according to Malaysian rates and exemptions?
‚Ä¢ Check compliance against LHDN requirements automatically?

We integrate with most accounting systems, so you get the best of both worlds. Would you like to see how that works?"

**Objection 3: "The price seems expensive for a small business"**

**Response:**
"I appreciate you being upfront about budget concerns - that's exactly why we built Easy e-Invoice with SMEs in mind.

Let me put this in perspective:
‚Ä¢ RM 29/month is less than RM 1 per day
‚Ä¢ One LHDN penalty can cost RM 200-50,000
‚Ä¢ The time you save is probably worth 10x our monthly fee
‚Ä¢ You can start completely free with up to 10 invoices

Plus, think about what you're paying for manual processes now - the time, the stress, the risk of errors. Most customers tell us we actually save them money from day one.

Would it help to start with our free tier and see the value for yourself?"

**Objection 4: "I need to discuss this with my accountant/partner"**

**Response:**
"Absolutely - that's a smart approach. In fact, we'd love to include your accountant in the conversation if they're open to it.

Many accountants actually recommend Easy e-Invoice to their SME clients because:
‚Ä¢ It reduces their workload on basic compliance checking
‚Ä¢ It gives them confidence their clients are following best practices
‚Ä¢ It provides audit trails and documentation they need

Would it be helpful if I sent you some information specifically designed for accountants? Or would your accountant be available for a quick call where I can show them the compliance features?"

**Objection 5: "We don't have many invoices, so this isn't worth it"**

**Response:**
"That's actually perfect - you're exactly who we built this for. Even if you only create a few invoices per month, each one needs to be 100% compliant or you risk penalties.

With fewer invoices, the percentage impact is even bigger:
‚Ä¢ Turn a 30-minute manual process into a 3-minute automated one
‚Ä¢ Guarantee compliance instead of hoping you got everything right
‚Ä¢ Create a professional impression that helps with collections

And with our free tier covering up to 10 invoices monthly, you might not even need to pay anything. Why not try it risk-free and see if it helps?"

**Objection 6: "This seems too technical/complicated for us"**

**Response:**
"I totally understand that concern - that's exactly why we designed Easy e-Invoice to be as simple as sending a WhatsApp message.

Here's what the process actually looks like:
1. Click 'Create Invoice'  
2. Type customer name (we find them automatically)
3. Add what you sold and how much
4. Click 'Send'

That's it. The platform handles all the technical compliance stuff behind the scenes - TIN validation, SST calculations, industry codes, everything.

Most customers create their first compliant invoice within 5 minutes of signing up. Would you like me to show you exactly how simple it is?"
