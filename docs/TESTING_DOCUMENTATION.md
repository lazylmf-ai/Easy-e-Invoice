## Test Data Management

### Test Factories
The test suites use comprehensive factory functions to generate test data:

```typescript
// Example: Malaysian compliant invoice factory
const createTestInvoice = (overrides = {}): Invoice => ({
  invoiceNumber: 'INV-2024-001',
  eInvoiceType: '01' as const,
  issueDate: '2024-01-15',
  dueDate: '2024-02-15',
  currency: 'MYR' as const,
  exchangeRate: '1.000000',
  // ... complete invoice structure
  ...overrides
});
```

### Database Setup
- Automated test database creation with Docker
- Schema migration for each test run
- Data cleanup between tests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Database Connection
```bash
# Reset test database
docker rm -f test-postgres
npm run test:setup

# Check database status
docker ps | grep test-postgres
```

#### Coverage Threshold Failures
```bash
# Generate detailed coverage report
npm run test:unit -- --coverage --reporter=verbose

# Check specific file coverage
npx vitest --coverage --reporter=html
open coverage/index.html
```

#### Playwright Browser Issues
```bash
# Reinstall browsers
npx playwright install --with-deps

# Run in headed mode for debugging
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Performance Optimization
- Use `--singleFork` for performance tests to avoid interference
- Configure appropriate timeouts for different test types
- Monitor memory usage during long-running test suites

## Conclusion

The comprehensive testing infrastructure ensures the reliability, security, and performance of the Easy e-Invoice system. With >94% code coverage, multi-layered testing approach, and automated quality gates, the system is well-prepared for production deployment while maintaining Malaysian e-Invoice compliance standards.
