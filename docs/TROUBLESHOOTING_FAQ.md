## üîê Login & Authentication Issues

### Q: I'm not receiving the magic link email

**A: Try these solutions in order:**

1. **Check your spam/junk folder** - Magic links sometimes get filtered
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** - Email delivery can be delayed
3. **Add `noreply@yourdomain.com` to your contacts** - This prevents future filtering
4. **Request a new magic link** - The previous one may have expired (15-minute limit)
5. **Try a different email address** - Your email provider might be blocking our emails

**Still not working?** Contact support with your email address.

### Q: The magic link says it's expired

**A: Magic links expire after 15 minutes for security.**

**Solution:**
1. Go back to the login page
2. Enter your email address again
3. Request a new magic link
4. Use it within 15 minutes

### Q: I get "Invalid token" error when clicking magic link

**A: This usually happens when:**
- The link was already used
- The link is from an old email
- There's a browser/cache issue

**Solutions:**
1. **Request a fresh magic link** - Don't use old emails
2. **Open link in incognito/private mode** - This bypasses cache issues
3. **Clear your browser cache** - Old tokens might be cached
4. **Try a different browser** - Sometimes browser extensions interfere

### Q: I forgot which email I used to register

**A: Unfortunately, we can't look up accounts by name for privacy reasons.**

**Try these:**
1. **Check common email addresses** you use for business
2. **Look for old Easy e-Invoice emails** in your inbox
3. **Contact support** - We can help verify your account with additional information

## üè¢ Organization Setup Issues

### Q: My TIN number is not being accepted

**A: Malaysian TIN formats are very specific:**

**Company TIN (Sdn Bhd, Bhd, etc.):**
- Format: `C` + 10 digits
- Example: `C1234567890`
- Must be exactly 11 characters

**Individual TIN:**
- Format: 12 digits only
- Example: `123456789012`
- No letters, no spaces

**Government TIN:**
- Format: `G` + 10 digits
- Example: `G1234567890`

**Non-profit TIN:**
- Format: `N` + 10 digits
- Example: `N1234567890`

**Solutions:**
1. **Double-check the format** - No spaces, correct prefix
2. **Verify with SSM** - Check your company registration documents
3. **Contact LHDN** - They can confirm your correct TIN
4. **Try without spaces/dashes** - Use only the required format

### Q: I can't find my industry code (MSIC 2008)

**A: Industry codes are 5-digit MSIC 2008 codes.**

**Common codes:**
- `62010` - Computer Programming
- `69201` - Accounting Services
- `46900` - General Trading
- `85421` - Business and Management Consultancy
- `96012` - Hairdressing and Beauty Services

**To find your code:**
1. **Visit [dosm.gov.my](https://dosm.gov.my)** - Official MSIC 2008 database
2. **Check your SSM registration** - It might be listed there
3. **Use the search function** - Search by activity description
4. **Contact support** - We can help identify the correct code

### Q: SST settings are confusing - what should I choose?

**A: SST (Sales & Service Tax) settings depend on your registration:**

**If you're SST registered:**
- ‚úÖ Check "SST Registered"
- SST Rate: `6%` (standard rate)
- Enter your SST number
- SST will be automatically calculated on invoices

**If you're NOT SST registered:**
- ‚ùå Uncheck "SST Registered"
- No SST will be added to invoices
- This is fine for small businesses under the SST threshold

**Not sure?** Check with your accountant or LHDN.

## üìÑ Invoice Creation Issues

### Q: Invoice validation is failing with low score

**A: Validation scores below 70% indicate compliance issues.**

**Common issues and fixes:**

**TIN Format Issues (MY-001):**
- Fix: Use correct Malaysian TIN format (see above)

**Missing Required Fields (MY-002):**
- Fix: Fill in all required fields marked with *

**Incorrect SST Calculation (MY-006):**
- Fix: Verify SST rate (usually 6%) and registration status

**Invalid Industry Code (MY-004):**
- Fix: Use valid MSIC 2008 code (5 digits)

**Address Format Issues (MY-008):**
- Fix: Include full Malaysian address with postcode and state

### Q: SST calculation seems wrong

**A: Common SST calculation issues:**

**Problem:** SST showing as 0% when it should be 6%
**Solution:** 
1. Check your SST registration status in Organization Settings
2. Verify the line item has SST rate set to 6%
3. Ensure the item is not SST-exempt

**Problem:** SST calculation is incorrect amount
**Solution:**
1. SST = (Line Total - Discount) √ó SST Rate
2. Example: (RM 1000 - RM 50) √ó 6% = RM 57
3. Use our SST calculator in the help section

**Problem:** Some items should be SST-exempt
**Solution:** 
Set SST rate to 0% for exempt items like:
- Basic food items
- Medical services
- Education services
- Exported goods

### Q: Buyer's TIN validation keeps failing

**A: Buyer TIN validation is optional but helpful for B2B invoices.**

**Solutions:**
1. **For business buyers:** Use correct TIN format (C1234567890)
2. **For individual buyers:** Use 12-digit IC number or leave blank
3. **For government buyers:** Use G-prefix format (G1234567890)
4. **If unsure:** Leave TIN field blank - it's not mandatory

### Q: I can't edit an invoice I created

**A: This depends on the invoice status:**

**Draft invoices:** Can be edited freely
**Finalized invoices:** Cannot be edited (by design for audit trail)
**Submitted invoices:** Cannot be edited (already sent to LHDN)

**Solutions:**
1. **If draft:** Check if you have edit permissions
2. **If finalized:** Create a new invoice or credit note for corrections
3. **If submitted:** Contact support for serious errors only

## üì§ Import/Export Issues

### Q: CSV import is failing with errors

**A: CSV import issues are usually data format problems.**

**Common fixes:**

**Use the correct template:**
1. Download our CSV template from the import page
2. Don't change column headers
3. Follow the exact format shown

**Date format issues:**
- Use: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2024-01-15`)
- Don't use: `DD/MM/YYYY` or `MM/DD/YYYY`

**Currency format issues:**
- Use: `1000.50` (decimal point, no commas)

**TIN format issues:**
- Follow Malaysian TIN rules (see above)
- Leave blank if not applicable

**Required fields:**
- Invoice Number, Issue Date, Currency, Grand Total are required
- Buyer Name is required
- At least one line item is required

### Q: CSV file is too large and timing out

**A: Large files can cause timeouts.**

**Solutions:**
1. **Split your file** - Try importing 500-1000 records at a time
2. **Check file size** - Keep under 10MB
3. **Remove empty rows** - Delete unused rows in your spreadsheet
4. **Simplify data** - Remove unnecessary columns from template

### Q: Export is taking too long or failing

**A: Large exports can be slow.**

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce date range** - Export smaller time periods

3. **Choose format wisely** - CSV is faster than PDF for large datasets
4. **Try off-peak hours** - Less server load in the evening

## üíæ Data & Performance Issues

### Q: The system is running slowly

**A: Performance issues can have several causes:**

**Browser issues:**

3. **Contact support** - If problems persist

### Q: My data seems to be missing

**A: Data doesn't disappear, but here's what to check:**

**Check filters:**
1. **Date filters** - Expand date range to see older data

- **Telecommunications** (61XXX codes)
